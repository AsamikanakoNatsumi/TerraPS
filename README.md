## Guide

### Prerequisites

- Rust. (You can install it via Rustup or any way you prefer.)
    - A text editor is also recommended.
- Python (for updating the project.)
- Nushell.

### Building from source

#### Windows

- Run `envsetup.nu` to setup the environment.
    - Ensure your Python installation is available in `$PATH`.
        - This can be achieved if you installed Python through [scoop](https://scoop.sh/).
- Run `build.nu`.

#### Linux

TBA

#### macOS

### Usage

- The compiled binaries would be available under the `packaged/` directory as an `.7z` file for ease of distribution.
    - Simply extract the `.7z` archive and execute the `.exe` file.
    - Any errors reports would be appreciated.
- No redirector provided. You ship it yourself.
